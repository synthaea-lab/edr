# Provisioning for the lab's Arch Linux VM (rolling, glibc, x86_64): Rust +
# eBPF toolchain for building the agent and probes, plus the packages the
# lab/scenarios/ scripts need. Companion to linux-toolchain.sh (Debian/RPM)
# and alpine-toolchain.sh (musl) — see issue #124. Idempotent: rerunnable via
# `vagrant provision <machine>` or a plain re-run.
#
# The point of this box is that it moves: rolling repos mean whatever kernel
# and LLVM/clang are current the day someone runs `vagrant up` here, which is
# exactly where #53's no-CO-RE fragility and the bpf-linker/rustc-nightly
# LLVM-major alignment (see linux-toolchain.sh's comment on that) are most
# likely to drift first. Record the versions actually seen in lab/MATRIX.md
# after a run, don't hardcode them here.
