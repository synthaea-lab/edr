# Provisioning for the lab's Alpine VM (musl/BusyBox, x86_64): Rust + eBPF
# toolchain for building the agent and probes, plus the packages the
# lab/scenarios/ scripts need. Companion to linux-toolchain.sh (Debian/RPM) —
# see issue #123. Idempotent: rerunnable via `vagrant provision <machine>` or
# a plain re-run.
#
# Unlike linux-toolchain.sh, this script does NOT need to align bpf-linker's
# LLVM major with the pinned nightly's: `cargo install bpf-linker` on Alpine
# hits a genuine musl linking bug (the resulting binary has no PT_INTERP
# segment — it's built as a static/dynamic hybrid that crashes on the very
# first LLVM call, SIGSEGV, no usable error). The upstream prebuilt release
# (musl-static, bundles its own LLVM) sidesteps that entirely and was
# verified to work against BOTH the pinned nightly (LLVM 22) and a plain
# `rustup toolchain install nightly` (LLVM 23) on Alpine 3.24 — no alignment
# dance needed. Full source-build post-mortem (three stacked bugs, how each
# was diagnosed) is in the #123 PR discussion if a future bpf-linker release
# regresses this and the prebuilt-release workaround stops being enough.
