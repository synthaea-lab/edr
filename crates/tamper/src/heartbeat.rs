//! Sensor-silence detection — the enforcement of the self-protection invariant
//! "silence is a detection" (`docs/architecture/threat-model.md`, §2).
//!
//! An adversary who cannot beat the detections tries to switch a sensor off instead:
//! stop the ETW session, detach an eBPF program, suspend the agent so it is alive
//! (no respawn fires) but frozen. Each of those produces the same observable —
//! telemetry stops — and this module turns that observable into an alert.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! - Each sensor holds a [`SensorHeartbeat`] and [`pulse`](SensorHeartbeat::pulse)es
//!   it as events flow. A pulse is one relaxed atomic increment: cheap enough to sit
//!   on the hot event path.
//! - A [`SilenceMonitor`] — run from the **watchdog** or a thread not subject to the
//!   same freeze as the sensor it watches — polls the shared counters. A counter that
//!   has not advanced within its deadline is a [`SilenceVerdict`]: that sensor has
//!   gone dark.
//!
//! ## Determinism (the F-2 lesson)
//!
//! A healthy sensor on an *idle* host produces no events, which is indistinguishable
//! from a blinded one. The Windows sensor solved this (audit F-2) with a canary: it
//! writes its own temp file every interval, which *must* produce a Kernel-File event,
//! so a healthy sensor pulses even when the host is quiet. This module is the
//! platform-agnostic half — the counting and the deadline — and expects each sensor
//! to keep its heartbeat live by whatever canary its platform needs. Where a sensor
//! cannot self-generate traffic, the monitor still catches a *total* stall; the
//! canary is what tightens "no events" into "no events despite guaranteed activity".
