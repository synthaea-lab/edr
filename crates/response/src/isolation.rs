//! Host isolation (ADR-0037): block every connection in and out of the host except
//! loopback, DHCP and the agent's own path to its control plane.
//!
//! Platform-neutral, the same split as [`crate::kill`]: this module owns the plan, the
//! policy gate, the persisted intent and the decision a start-up reconciliation makes.
//! The firewall itself (WFP on Windows) is a [`HostFirewall`] the `agent` binary
//! implements per platform, so `response` gains no platform branch.
//!
//! The intent is written **before** the firewall changes, and a reconciliation at start-up
//! makes the firewall match it. So a crash between the two leaves the host converging to
//! what the operator last asked for, not to whatever half-state the crash left.
