//! # ml
//!
//! On-device ML scoring. Extracts feature vectors from events and correlation state, and
//! runs ONNX models (trained by the `ml/` Python pipeline) for anomaly and behavior
//! scoring via statically linked onnxruntime (`ort`). Models are loaded from the update
//! channel, never embedded (ADR-0002). Must be bounded in CPU and memory — inference
//! happens on the endpoint.
//!
//! - [`features`] — the feature extractors, each a Rust/Python parity seam pinned by a
//!   shared golden fixture;
//! - [`forest`] — tree structure parsed back out of the ONNX model, for per-feature
//!   attribution (the explanation side of "never a bare score", `docs/detection/ml.md`);
//! - [`bounds`] — out-of-distribution detection (issue #46);
//! - [`scorer`] — [`CmdlineScorer`] (T0), [`BehaviorScorer`] (T1) and [`CorrelationScorer`] (T2), which run a
//!   model through `ort` and pair each score with its attribution.
