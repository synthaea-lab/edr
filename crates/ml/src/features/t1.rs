//! The T1 behavior vector: cmdline (9) + correlation (8) = 17 features, in that order.
//! The Rust mirror of `ml/synthaea_ml/features/t1.py` (issue #617).
//!
//! **No lineage block** (ADR-0034): six lineage columns were measured on real lab captures
//! and made the forest worse for the attacks whose parent is ordinary. The parent is judged
//! by rules (`rules::check_web_server_spawns_shell`); [`lineage`] stays as an extractor.
//!
//! One process incarnation `(pid, generation)` yields one vector: the command line comes
//! from its most recent exec in the bus window, the correlation block from that
//! incarnation's events. Both lookups go through
//! [`EventBus::events_for_pid`], so a recycled pid's earlier life feeds neither the
//! counts nor the command line that is scored (#590): two known, different generations never
//! mix, a missing stamp keeps the pid-only behavior.
//!
//! A parity seam like the other extractors: `ml/tests/fixtures/t1_golden.jsonl` is
//! produced by Python (`gen_t1_parity.py`) and checked from both sides. A T1 model
//! trained on the Python vectors only scores consistently here if they match.
