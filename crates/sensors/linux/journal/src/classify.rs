//! Allowlist classification: turns a [`JournalRecord`] into a [`JournalEvent`], or
//! `None` for the (vast majority of) journal traffic outside the four categories in
//! this crate's scope (issue #93). Never ships the whole journal — a category not
//! listed here is silently ignored, not logged as "unclassified".
//!
//! **Unit lifecycle is classified by `JOB_TYPE`/`JOB_RESULT`, not by the systemd
//! message-catalog UUID** (`MESSAGE_ID`), even though systemd does publish stable
//! catalog constants for this (e.g. `SD_MESSAGE_UNIT_STARTED`). Two reasons: first,
//! `JOB_TYPE=start`/`JOB_RESULT=done` is what this crate's author could actually
//! verify against a real capture on this dev machine (see `record.rs`'s tests) —
//! copying an opaque hex constant from memory into a security-relevant classifier,
//! unverified, is exactly the kind of mistake that fails silently. Second, a
//! reviewer can read `JOB_TYPE`/`JOB_RESULT` and audit the logic without looking up
//! what a 32-hex-digit UUID means.
//!
//! sshd accept/failure and `su` are classified against the standard, documented
//! OpenSSH/PAM log line formats but are **not** verified against a real capture —
//! this dev sandbox has no `sshd`, and `su` here requires interactive auth this
//! non-interactive session can't provide. Flagged as a lab-validation follow-up
//! (see the crate doc's Status section), same as issue #91's kernel-dependent paths.
//!
//! `classify_pam` matches the `pam_unix(`/`pam_sss(` prefixes (#881), the latter
//! checked against SSSD's own upstream source rather than assumed (see the
//! function's doc). `pam_ldap` and `pam_faillock` are still not matched — not
//! confirmed safe to skip, just unconfirmed either way (`pam_ldap`) or a different
//! message shape entirely (`pam_faillock`) — so the T1548.003 burst-then-success
//! join (`crates/rules/src/sudo.rs`) can still silently miss failures on a host
//! using either. A host stacking `pam_unix` and `pam_sss` as two authenticators for
//! the *same* account (not the usual one-module-per-account-source arrangement)
//! could also double-count one failed password as two — open question, not ruled
//! out. Neither `pam_unix` nor `pam_sss`'s lines are live-validated against a real
//! sssd host here (no such host in this dev sandbox) — same documented-format
//! caveat as the sshd lines above.
