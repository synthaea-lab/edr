#![no_std]
//! # sensor-linux-wire
//!
//! The ring-buffer ABI between the eBPF probes (`../ebpf`, `bpfel-unknown-none`) and
//! the userspace loader (`../userspace`): fixed-size `repr(C)` structs written by the
//! kernel side and read back with `read_unaligned` on the user side. Both crates must
//! be built from the same revision — this is an internal ABI, not a stable format.
//!
//! These types are deliberately NOT the agent's event model: the loader normalizes
//! them into `schema` types. The fixed limits below are wire/kernel constraints (the
//! eBPF stack is 512 bytes and events are built in place on it), not product limits —
//! truncation at these bounds is a sensor property reported by conformance.
//! `ExecEvent` is built in a `PerCpuArray` because `image` alone already exceeds the
//! stack budget.

// The "user" feature (userspace loader + uprobes sensor) brings std in for the
// shared decode helpers at the bottom; the eBPF build stays pure no_std.
#[cfg(feature = "user")]

/// Bumped on every layout-affecting change to the structs below. Not a wire header
/// (ring-buffer items carry none) — a build-time tripwire: the userspace loader
/// `const _`-asserts the value it was compiled against, so an ebpf/userspace version
/// skew fails the build instead of misreading bytes at runtime.
///
/// - v1: initial exec/open/connect structs.
/// - v2: `ExecEvent` gains `image`/`image_len` (authoritative image path from the
///   tracepoint, issue #111) and `pcomm` (parent name from the fork-lineage map,
///   issue #53). `cmdline` is unchanged (`mm->arg_*` blob).
/// - v3: `ExecEvent` drops `cmdline`/`cmdline_len` — argv is read from
///   `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` by the userspace loader (issue #152), so the probe no
///   longer touches a `task_struct`/`mm_struct` frozen offset at all.
/// - v4: `EventMeta` gains `cgroup_id` (`bpf_get_current_cgroup_id()`, captured at
///   probe time, issue #204) — closes the drain-time `/proc` exit race for
///   container attribution: the userspace loader resolves it against cgroupfs
///   instead of `/proc/<pid>/cgroup`, which no longer needs the pid to still exist.
/// - v5: `TlsCaptureEvent` and `ReadlineInputEvent` added for uprobes (issue #90).
///   TLS capture budgeted at 256 bytes (first N bytes of plaintext), readline at
///   512 bytes (full interactive command line).
/// - v6: `FileWriteEvent`, `FileDeleteEvent`, `FileRenameEvent` added (issue #262).
///   `FileWriteEvent` carries no path — `write(2)`/`pwrite64(2)` take a file
///   descriptor, not a path, and this codebase resolves no `fd`→path mapping
///   (kernel-side `d_path`/`bpf_d_path` nor a userspace `/proc/<pid>/fd/<n>`
///   lookup); it is a volume/frequency signal (burst-write detection), not a
///   per-write path trail. `FileDeleteEvent`/`FileRenameEvent` read real path
///   arguments straight off the syscall, same as `FileOpenEvent`.
/// - v7: `SocketBindEvent` added (issue #263) — `bind(2)` only. Same
///   family-filtered (`AF_INET`/`AF_INET6`) sockaddr read as `ConnectEvent`;
///   `listen(2)` (no address, just `fd`+`backlog`) and `accept(2)`/`accept4(2)`
///   (needs a `sys_exit` probe to read the kernel-filled peer address — a new
///   probe shape this crate doesn't have yet) are deliberately deferred.
/// - v8: `FileChmodEvent`/`FileChownEvent` added (issue #262 Phase 2) —
///   `chmod(2)`/`fchmodat(2)` and `chown(2)`/`lchown(2)`/`fchownat(2)`. All five
///   read a real path argument, unlike `FileWriteEvent`. `fchmod(2)`/`fchown(2)`
///   (fd-only, no path) are deferred the same way `write(2)`'s fd-only shape was
///   handled: a future addition, not a silent gap.
/// - v9: `UdpSendEvent` added (issue #263 Phase 2) — `sendto(2)` only, same
///   family-filtered sockaddr read as `ConnectEvent`/`SocketBindEvent`, plus the
///   caller's requested payload size. `recvfrom(2)` is deliberately NOT captured:
///   its source-address output parameter is only populated by the kernel after the
///   syscall returns, the same `sys_exit_*` probe shape `accept`/`accept4` need and
///   this crate doesn't have yet. `send(2)` (no destination arg) is also not
///   captured — glibc issues it as `sendto(fd, buf, len, flags, NULL, 0)`, which
///   this probe's null-address check already skips, same as `connect`/`bind`.
/// - v10: `SocketListenEvent` added (issue #263 Phase 2) — `listen(2)`. `listen(2)`'s
///   own args are just `fd`+`backlog`, no address, so the probe correlates against
///   an in-kernel `(pid, fd) -> address` map populated by `sys_enter_bind` (internal
///   to the ebpf crate, not part of this wire ABI). No matching `bind()` observed —
///   probe attached after it happened, or the kernel's implicit ephemeral-port bind
///   at `listen()` time — leaves `addr_resolved: false` and the address fields
///   zeroed, rather than silently dropping the event. `accept(2)`/`accept4(2)`
///   remain deferred (still need the `sys_exit` probe shape).
/// - v11: `SocketAcceptEvent` added (issue #263 Phase 2) — `accept(2)`/`accept4(2)`.
///   First use of the paired `sys_enter_*`/`sys_exit_*` probe shape in this crate:
///   the peer address is only populated by the kernel once the syscall returns, so
///   `sys_enter_accept{,4}` stashes the caller's `(fd, addr_ptr)` in an in-kernel
///   map keyed by `pid_tgid` (internal to the ebpf crate, not part of this wire
///   ABI — same pattern as `sensor-linux-uprobes`' `SSL_READ_ARGS`), and
///   `sys_exit_accept{,4}` reads the return value (the new fd, or a negative errno)
///   and, on success, the now-populated sockaddr from the stashed pointer. Only
///   emitted on success — a failed `accept()` has no peer to report.
/// - v12: `FileSetxattrEvent`/`FileRemovexattrEvent` added (issue #262 Phase 3) —
///   `setxattr(2)`/`removexattr(2)` only (the `l`/`f` fd/symlink-only variants are
///   deferred, same posture as `chmod`/`chown`'s fd-only siblings). Captures the
///   xattr `name` (e.g. `security.capability` — the Linux file-capability grant
///   `setcap` writes, functionally the "+s" of extended attributes) but not
///   `value`: the namespace+attribute name is what most detections need, and
///   `value` is an arbitrary-length secondary read this slice does not add.
/// - v13: `MountEvent`/`SignalEvent` added (issue #362), `KernelModuleEvent` and
///   `BpfEvent` added (issue #264). `MountEvent` covers `mount(2)`/`umount2(2)`
///   (`move_mount(2)` deferred, same "known gap, not silently dropped" treatment
///   as `fchmod`/`fchown`'s fd-only variants). `umount2(2)`'s actual kernel
///   tracepoint is `syscalls:sys_enter_umount`, not `sys_enter_umount2`: glibc's
///   `umount2(2)` libc wrapper maps to a kernel syscall the kernel itself
///   (`fs/namespace.c`) names plain `umount`, confirmed live on the lab 2026-09-23
///   after the assumed `sys_enter_umount2` turned out not to exist. `fs_type` gets
///   its own small `MAX_FS_TYPE_LEN` budget — filesystem type names (`ext4`,
///   `overlay`, `tmpfs`, ...) never approach `MAX_PATH_LEN`. `SignalEvent` covers
///   `kill(2)`/`tgkill(2)`, filtered at the probe via `SIGNAL_WATCH_PID` (internal
///   to the ebpf crate, not part of this wire ABI) to targets that are the agent's
///   own pid — the "tamper subset, never the firehose" filter `SignalToEsClient`
///   uses on macOS (its ES-client gate), scoped down to just self-protection for
///   v1 (watchdog/other registered security processes are a documented future
///   extension, not implemented here). `tkill(2)` is deferred: it takes a thread
///   id, not a thread-group id, and has no field comparable to the whole-process
///   pid this filter watches for. `KernelModuleEvent` covers kernel module
///   load/unload (`init_module(2)`/`finit_module(2)`/`delete_module(2)`) —
///   `KernelModuleEvent::name` is only populated for `delete_module(2)`, the only
///   one of the three that receives a module name as a real syscall argument;
///   `init_module`/`finit_module` load a raw ELF image whose module name lives
///   inside the blob itself, not decoded here (same "sensor reports the syscall
///   boundary, not the payload" posture as `FileWriteEvent`'s no-path stance).
///   `BpfEvent` covers the eBPF program/map lifecycle (`bpf(2)`), filtered
///   in-kernel to `BPF_MAP_CREATE`, `BPF_PROG_LOAD`, and `BPF_PROG_ATTACH` only —
///   every other `bpf(2)` command (map lookups/updates, the overwhelming majority
///   of real traffic, including this agent's own sensor loading its probes) never
///   reaches the ring buffer, the same "never the firehose" discipline as
///   `SIGNAL_WATCH_PID` filtering.
///   Originally claimed as v12 while this branch was open; renumbered to v13
///   once `#262` Phase 3's xattr telemetry took v12 on `main` first (same
///   coordination note as `SCHEMA_VERSION`'s v13/v19/v20 history).
/// - v14: `PtraceEvent`, `ProcessVmReadEvent`, `ProcessVmWriteEvent`,
///   `MemfdCreateEvent` added (issue #265) — process injection/debugging
///   telemetry: `ptrace(2)` (every request, unfiltered — the request code itself
///   is the signal), `process_vm_readv(2)`/`process_vm_writev(2)` (cross-process
///   memory access without ptrace's attach/stop dance), `memfd_create(2)`
///   (anonymous-fd fileless-execution primitive). The two `process_vm_*` events
///   carry each iovec array's element count plus the first remote-iovec entry's
///   `iov_len` (a size signal, not a full scatter-gather resolution) — same
///   "requested size, not full path/content" tradeoff `FileWriteEvent` and
///   `UdpSendEvent::size` already make.
/// - v15: `IdentityChangeEvent`, `CapSetEvent`, and `NamespaceEvent` added
///   (issue #266) — privilege escalation, capability abuse, and container
///   escape via namespace manipulation. `IdentityChangeEvent` covers
///   `setuid(2)`/`setgid(2)`/`setresuid(2)`/`setresgid(2)`/`setfsuid(2)`/
///   `setfsgid(2)` with a `kind` discriminant (same shape as `MountEvent`'s
///   `mounted` bool and `#264`'s `KernelModuleEvent::action` — one event
///   family, several closely related syscalls). `CapSetEvent` decodes only
///   the low 32 capability bits (`__user_cap_data_struct[0]`) of
///   `capset(2)`'s requested effective/permitted/inheritable sets — every
///   capability an attacker plausibly cares about (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`=21,
///   `CAP_SETUID`=7, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`=12, ...) is below bit 32; the high word
///   (`__user_cap_data_struct[1]`, capabilities 32+: `CAP_BPF`,
///   `CAP_PERFMON`, `CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE`) is not read. `NamespaceEvent`
///   covers `setns(2)` (the actual container-escape primitive — joining a
///   host namespace from inside a container) and `unshare(2)` with a
///   `syscall` discriminant. `prctl(PR_SET_SECUREBITS)`/`prctl(PR_CAPBSET_DROP)`
///   (also listed on #266) are deliberately deferred: both are one `option`
///   value out of `prctl(2)`'s dozens, needing a filtered `sys_enter_prctl`
///   probe shaped like the `sys_enter_bpf` cmd filter (#264) — a future
///   addition, not silently dropped.
/// - v16: `GetAddrInfoEvent` added (issue #267 Phase 1) — a uprobe/uretprobe
///   pair on glibc's `getaddrinfo(3)`, the DNS-based C2/tunneling/
///   exfiltration visibility this crate had none of. Entry stashes the
///   query-name pointer and the caller's `struct addrinfo **res` output-
///   parameter pointer (`GETADDRINFO_ARGS`, internal to the ebpf crate, same
///   pid_tgid-keyed correlation-map shape as `SSL_READ_ARGS`); exit reads the
///   return code and, on success, dereferences `*res` and decodes only the
///   *first* `addrinfo` entry's family + address — a real query commonly
///   returns several (one per A/AAAA record, sometimes both), and walking
///   the whole linked list is deferred, same "first element only" tradeoff
///   as `#265`'s `ProcessVmReadEvent::remote_iov_len`. Emitted on failure
///   too (`status != 0`, no address fields) — a resolution failure is itself
///   a signal (DGA malware generates many). musl's internal resolver,
///   systemd-resolved's D-Bus path, and raw UDP/TCP port-53 capture (DoH/DoT
///   blind spots either way) are `#267`'s Phase 2, not implemented here.
///   Originally claimed as v12 while this branch was open; renumbered to v13
///   once `#262` Phase 3's xattr telemetry took v12, then to v14 once #362 and
///   #264 took v13 on `main`, then to v16 once #265 and #266 took v14/v15
///   (same coordination note as `SCHEMA_VERSION`).
/// - v17: `CapSetEvent`'s `effective`/`permitted`/`inheritable` widen from
///   `u32` to `u64` (issue #457). The probe now also reads
///   `__user_cap_data_struct[1]`, the high word v15 skipped: capabilities 32+
///   (`CAP_PERFMON`=38, `CAP_BPF`=39, `CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE`=40) are what
///   loading eBPF without full `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` takes, so the v15 "low word is
///   enough" call no longer holds. The high word is read only when
///   `cap_user_header_t.version` is not `_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_1`, whose
