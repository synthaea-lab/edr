//! # sensor-linux-netlink
//!
//! Kernel netlink families as a supplementary, zero-probe source:
//! - `sock_diag` — periodic socket-table snapshots (listening/established with
//!   inode→pid join): listen-port telemetry and drift detection without a probe.
//! - `nfnetlink conntrack` — flow accounting (bytes/packets/duration per flow),
//!   giving beacon detection volume/periodicity features events alone lack.
//! - proc connector — fork/exec/exit notifications as a cheap cross-check for the
//!   eBPF stream (a gap between the two is itself a tamper signal).
//!
//! No special kernel config; runs where eBPF cannot; complements, never replaces,
//! the probe-based sensors.
//!
//! **Status (issue #92, foundation):** `sock_diag` is done — [`snapshot`] queries
//! TCP listening/established sockets (IPv4 + IPv6) via a hand-rolled
//! `NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG` client ([`wire`]/[`socket`]) and joins each one to its
//! owning PID(s) by scanning `/proc` ([`proc_join`]), the same technique `ss`/
//! `lsof` use. Verified against this dev machine's real kernel — no root needed
//! (confirmed empirically: `sock_diag` for TCP works unprivileged, unlike
//! conntrack below).
//!
//! **conntrack is also done** — [`conntrack_socket::dump`] queries the kernel's
//! conntrack table (IPv4 + IPv6) over `NETLINK_NETFILTER`/`ctnetlink`
//! ([`conntrack_attrs`]/[`conntrack_socket`]), decoding each flow's 5-tuple
//! (both directions), status, timeout, and packet/byte accounting when the
//! kernel provides it. This is the recursive `nlattr` tree (`CTA_TUPLE_ORIG` ->
//! `CTA_TUPLE_IP` -> `CTA_IP_V4_SRC`) that made conntrack "a full netlink
//! sub-protocol of its own" rather than a `sock_diag`-sized job — confirmed
//! against a real capture on this dev machine byte for byte before being
//! pinned into tests. Accounting (`CTA_COUNTERS_*`) requires
//! `net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=1` on the target kernel — off by default,
//! confirmed empirically (no counters attribute appears at all until it is
//! turned on) — see [`conntrack_socket`]'s doc. Unprivileged reachability of
//! conntrack is not characterized (every capture here ran as root).
//!
//! **`CTA_PROTOINFO`'s TCP state is also decoded** — [`TcpState`], from
//! `CTA_PROTOINFO` -> `CTA_PROTOINFO_TCP` -> `CTA_PROTOINFO_TCP_STATE`, a
//! third level of `nlattr` nesting beyond the tuple's two. Only present for
//! TCP flows — confirmed against a real capture on this dev machine: UDP
//! dump entries carry no `CTA_PROTOINFO` attribute at all. The sibling
//! `CTA_PROTOINFO_TCP_WSCALE_*`/`_FLAGS_*` sub-attributes are decoded on the
//! wire but not surfaced — not needed for beacon volume/periodicity
//! features, same scoping call as `CTA_STATUS`'s individual `IPS_*` bits.
//!
//! **proc connector** (`NETLINK_CONNECTOR`, fork/exec/exit) is a separate,
//! independent foundation slice — see PR #179, not part of this one.
//!
//! **proc connector is also done** — [`ProcEventSubscription`] subscribes to the
//! kernel's `CN_IDX_PROC` multicast group over `NETLINK_CONNECTOR`
//! ([`proc_events`]/[`proc_socket`]) and decodes fork/exec/exit broadcasts. Root/
//! `CAP_NET_ADMIN`-only (unlike `sock_diag`): confirmed against this dev
//! machine that the kernel rejects the subscribe with `EPERM` for an
//! unprivileged caller, reported back as a proper `NetlinkError`, not a panic.
//!
//! **`schema::Event` wiring, for listening sockets:** [`listen_port_events`] maps
//! a [`snapshot`] to [`schema::Event::ListenPort`] (`schema` `SCHEMA_VERSION` 10 ->
//! 11) — the mapping issue #92's "listening-port drift" done-when item needs.
//! [`proc_meta`] resolves the `comm`/`ppid`/`gid` a [`schema::EventMeta`] needs
//! from `/proc/<pid>/status` (uid comes straight from the kernel via `sock_diag` —
//! see [`SocketSnapshotEntry::uid`]'s doc); [`normalize`] does the pure
//! entry-plus-proc-info -> `Event` mapping, same split as `sensor-linux`'s own
//! `normalize` module. A joined PID that can't be resolved (exited between the two
//! `/proc` reads, or another user's process without permission) is silently
//! skipped rather than emitted with fabricated metadata — a per-poll, best-effort
//! sample, not a guaranteed-complete one. Established sockets aren't mapped (no
//! drift semantics for them, see [`normalize::listen_port_event`]'s doc); this
//! crate still doesn't decide the polling cadence or run the drift comparison
//! itself — a caller (not yet written) calls [`listen_port_events`] repeatedly and
//! diffs consecutive results. No lab VM here to validate that live, same gap as
//! before this wiring existed.
//!
//! **`schema::Event` wiring, for conntrack flows:** [`conntrack_flow_events`] maps
//! a [`dump_conntrack`] dump to [`schema::Event::NetworkFlow`] (`schema`
//! `SCHEMA_VERSION` 11 -> 12) — the mapping issue #92's "conntrack features reach
//! the correlator" done-when item needs. A conntrack entry carries no PID at all
//! from the kernel, unlike `sock_diag`'s inode->pid join — attribution instead
//! joins the flow's tuple against a concurrent [`snapshot`]'s
//! `local`/`remote`/state, see [`normalize::conntrack_flow_events_for`]'s doc for
//! the two-orientation match this needs (outbound vs. locally-accepted) and why
//! `orig`/`reply`'s byte counters must be swapped for one of them relative to
//! "sent"/"received". TCP only — [`snapshot`] never queries UDP sockets, so a UDP
//! flow can never find a match (checked explicitly, not left to chance). A flow
//! nothing could attribute (already closed, permission-denied `/proc/<pid>/fd`,
//! or genuinely no matching local socket) produces no event, same discipline as
//! [`listen_port_events`]. Two kernel queries taken back to back, not atomically
//! — see [`conntrack_flow_events`]'s doc. Still not here: `crates/correlator`
//! wiring (below) and periodic polling/the beacon-scenario validation itself — no
//! lab VM here to generate one live.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** here yet:
//! - `schema::Event` wiring for the proc connector (the eBPF cross-check): the
//!   issue's role for it is a *tamper* signal (divergence from the eBPF stream),
//!   which may not want to be a `schema::Event` at all rather than an internal
//!   `crates/tamper` comparison — not a call this Linux-only slice should make
//!   alone.
//! - `crates/correlator` wiring: [`listen_port_events`]/[`conntrack_flow_events`]
//!   produce `schema::Event`s, but nothing in this crate hands them to
//!   `correlator::EventBus` — that's the caller's job (the same one that would own
//!   the polling cadence above), and no such caller exists yet for this crate's
//!   data.
//! - UDP sockets — `sock_diag` supports them, but "listen/established" (this
//!   issue's own wording) is TCP-state terminology; UDP would need its own
//!   category, not a states-mask filter.
//! - Periodic re-snapshotting / drift detection between snapshots — [`snapshot`]
//!   is a one-shot query; a caller decides the cadence. No lab VM here to
//!   validate the issue's "listening-port drift" done-when item against.
//! - `PROC_EVENT_UID`/`_GID`/`_SID`/`_PTRACE`/`_COMM`/`_COREDUMP` — decoded as
//!   [`ProcEvent::Other`] rather than their own variants; nothing in the eBPF
//!   stream to cross-check them against yet (see [`proc_events`]).

// The pure codec/normalize modules compile on every OS so their unit tests run
// anywhere, but their only callers are the linux-gated socket modules below —
// off-Linux, the lib target legitimately has unused items (same idiom as
// `agent/src/health.rs`). The lint stays live on Linux, where dead code is real.
