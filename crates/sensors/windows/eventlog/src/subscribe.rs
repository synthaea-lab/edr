//! Push-based transport for the Event Log sensor via `EvtSubscribe` (issue
//! #322). The default remains `Polling` (`sensor.rs`), see `EventLogTransport`
//! for the switch; this module is the alternative that removes the 2s poll
//! cadence, the `wevtutil` subprocess spawn per tick, and the "did we miss a
//! rotation" edge case — the OS delivers each matching event directly to a
//! callback the moment it lands in the channel.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! One `EvtSubscribe` call per enabled [`PollTarget`], each with:
//! - the target's `channel` + `id_filter` wrapped into the `*[System[...]]`
//!   `XPath` the polling code already builds
//! - a per-target callback that renders the event to XML with `EvtRender`,
//!   hands the XML to the same `target.parse_block` used by the polling code,
//!   increments the same counter, and dispatches to the same sink — so
//!   normalization, counters, and downstream consumers are identical between
//!   the two transports (only the delivery mechanism differs)
//!
//! The callback runs on a Windows thread-pool thread the caller does not
//! control, so the shared state must be `Send + Sync` — which the sensor's
//! `Arc<dyn EventSink>` / `Arc<EventLogCounters>` / `Arc<AtomicBool>` already
//! are.
//!
//! ## Lifetime
//!
//! [`subscribe`] returns a [`SubscriptionHandle`] that owns both the
//! `EVT_HANDLE` and the `Box<CallbackContext>` the OS holds a raw pointer to.
//! Dropping the handle closes the subscription (`EvtClose`) **before**
//! reclaiming the boxed context, in that order — otherwise the OS could
//! deliver one last callback into freed memory. See the `Drop` impl for the
//! ordering commentary.
//!
//! ## No `EvtRender` rewrite of the parser layer
//!
//! `EvtRender` with `EvtRenderEventXml` returns the exact same UTF-16 XML shape
//! `wevtutil qe /f:xml` produces (both wrap the underlying Event Log reader
//! API). So `xml::parse_service_install_block` and its siblings are reused
//! verbatim — the substring-based parsing that felt fragile under polling is
//! the same substring-based parsing that works under push, unchanged.
