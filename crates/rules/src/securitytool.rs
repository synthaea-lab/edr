//! SECURITY-TOOL-STOP (T1562.001, #379): a command that stops, or stops and disables, a named
//! security tool.
//!
//! The parser is [`crate::servicestop::services_stopped`] (SERVICE-STOP-BURST, T1489): what an
//! exec stops, from `systemctl` (`stop`, `disable --now`, `mask --now` and `kill` with a signal
//! that ends the unit), `service`, `net`, `sc`, `launchctl` and `Stop-Service`. The
//! burst rule counts how many services; this one asks **which**: a single `systemctl stop
//! falco` is what an intruder does to blind the host before acting, and it is below the
//! burst's threshold by design.
//!
//! What no command line shows is [`crate::unitstop`]'s (#1085): a stop over D-Bus or an API, or a
//! service that was killed, reaches the journal as a unit stop, and that rule alerts on the ones
//! no exec, restart or host shutdown explains. A stop this rule alerted on is among the ones it
//! treats as explained, so one `systemctl stop falco` is one finding.
