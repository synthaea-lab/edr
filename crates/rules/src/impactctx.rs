//! Impact context (#973): what an Impact finding is told about the lineage that caused it.
//!
//! Two facts, both attached to a finding that already exists. Neither raises anything by
//! itself, and neither changes what any other consumer reads.
//!
//! **A service-stop burst before mass renames (corroboration).** SERVICE-STOP-BURST (T1489,
//! [`crate::servicestop`]) remembers the lineage that raised it. When a T1486 finding comes
//! from the same lineage within [`BURST_TO_RENAME_WINDOW_NS`], the T1486 message says so. The
//! finding keeps its technique and its severity (Critical already, so there is nothing to
//! raise), no threshold moves, and the damage manifest and the reflex kill read the technique
//! and the event, never the message: the boundary kept by #381 holds.
//!
//! **A shutdown or reboot after an Impact finding (T1529, case context).** A reboot is
//! ordinary: patch windows, installers, cloud agents and every admin do it. So the command is
//! never a finding alone. It is reported, Low, only when the same lineage already raised a T1486
//! or a T1490 finding within [`IMPACT_TO_SHUTDOWN_WINDOW_NS`], and then it says that (the
//! host going down after encryption or recovery destruction is the finish of the run: it
//! drops what memory holds and ends the incident response in progress). Severity is Low so a
//! verdict, which takes the maximum over an entity's findings, cannot rise because of it.
//!
//! What identifies "the same lineage" is [`crate::recon::Lineage`], the process whose children
//! are counted together. A finding arms the lineages that can plausibly own the follow-up:
//! the lineage its process was exec'd under (the shell that launched an encryptor) and the
//! process itself (an encryptor that runs `reboot` as its own child).
//!
//! **Which command counts as a shutdown** is read from the program name where that is enough
//! (`shutdown`, `reboot`, `halt`, `poweroff`), because the argv of a short-lived process can
//! be empty (ADR-0045, #1118). The commands whose meaning is in the arguments (`systemctl
//! reboot`, `init 6`) count only when the arguments are there, which fails closed. A visible
//! argument that says the command does nothing (`shutdown -c`, `-k`, `--help`, `--dry-run`,
//! `reboot -w`, `shutdown /a`) is excluded. The better source for the fact itself is the
//! manager's own journal record (ADR-0006, `reboot.target`); it needs a new event and is not
//! built here.
