//! The shared half of "N authentication failures, then a success" rules (#880): the bounded,
//! event-time join [`crate::rdp`] and [`crate::sudo`] both build on.
//!
//! What is shared is the delicate part, so that a fix lands once: a sorted failure history and a
//! sorted success history per key, both capped; the join of a success to the failures in the
//! window that ends at it; one alert per success and one per fixed window; and the bound on the
//! windows remembered. What stays in each rule: the key (an address, an invoker uid, a target
//! name), what a success carries (`D`: the RDP user, nothing for `sudo`), the thresholds and
//! windows (their own constants in `exclusions`), and the alert itself (technique, severity,
//! message), which the caller builds in the closure it passes to [`History::join`].
//!
//! The join is on event time, not on arrival order: a success is remembered, a failure that
//! arrives later is checked against the successes it falls before, and either arrival can complete
//! the join. A failure timestamped after the success never counts. History is bounded by the caps
//! and the least-recently-seen key (the caller's `BoundedMap`), never by time: pruning against the
//! newest timestamp seen would let one event far in the future erase what a late event still
//! needs, and the alert count would depend on delivery order again.
