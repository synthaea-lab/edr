//! # schema
//!
//! The platform boundary of the agent: the normalized event model shared by every
//! sensor, the rule engine, the correlator, and the ML feature extractors, plus the
//! [`sensor`] contract every platform sensor implements.
//!
//! ## Semi-frozen API
//!
//! Every crate in the workspace depends on this one. Changes to public types ripple
//! everywhere and need explicit justification in review — prefer additive changes
//! (new fields with serde defaults, new [`Event`] variants) over reshaping what exists.
//!
//! **Every serialization-visible change bumps [`SCHEMA_VERSION`]** and adds a full
//! `tests/fixtures/v<N>/` snapshot (existing fixture files are never edited) — no
//! exception for additive changes, even though they don't break a Rust reader on
//! this crate's current types. This resolves issue #114 (closed): a change is
//! "visible" in three ways, and all three bump the version the same way —
//!
//! 1. **New optional field** on an existing type (e.g. [`EventMeta::container`],
//!    #169, v9 → v10) — non-breaking for a Rust reader (`#[serde(default)]`), but
//!    a non-Rust consumer (the server, a SIEM export) that snapshots the field set
//!    it deserializes still sees a change.
//! 2. **New [`Event`] variant** (e.g. `Event::Auth`, #94, v12 → v13) — non-breaking
//!    for a Rust reader too ([`Event`] is `#[non_exhaustive]`, forcing a wildcard
//!    match arm), but it changes the closed set of `"type"` tag values a consumer
//!    keying on that tag can see, the same concern as case 1.
//! 3. **Removal, rename, or type change** — breaking outright, bumps for the
//!    obvious reason.
//!
//! Bumping on 1 and 2 costs nothing (the version is metadata, not a compatibility
//! gate — old fixtures keep deserializing under new types, see
//! `tests/v1_compat.rs`) and buys every consumer an honest signal of "this shape
//! didn't exist before v*N*", which not bumping would silently hide. See
//! `docs/architecture/event-schema.md` for the full contract and worked examples.
//!
//! Not every change to this crate is a schema change: reusing bits within an
//! *existing* field (e.g. [`FLAG_PERSISTENCE_ARTIFACT`]) adds no new shape, so it
//! does not bump [`SCHEMA_VERSION`] — see that constant's doc comment. Nor is this
//! the same contract as a sensor's own wire ABI (e.g. `sensor-linux-wire`'s
//! `WIRE_VERSION`, bumped independently for #204): that governs the eBPF-to-
//! userspace struct layout on one platform, never this crate's public JSON model.
//!
//! ## What this crate is not
//!
//! Not the wire format. Sensors normalize their platform's native representation into
//! these types; fixed-size `repr(C)` structs for the eBPF ring buffer live with the
//! Linux sensor pair (`sensors/linux`), ETW layouts with `sensors/windows/etw`. The
//! old iteration let the eBPF wire format (fixed 256-byte buffers, `TASK_COMM_LEN`)
//! define the shared model; that is deliberately undone here — command lines and paths
//! are unbounded owned strings (Windows encoded-PowerShell command lines run to
//! kilobytes), and user identity is per-platform instead of a bare Unix uid.

/// This event carries **no path** — only `(pid, fd, bytes_requested)`. `write(2)` and

/// no fd→path mapping (neither kernel-side `bpf_d_path`/LSM hooks nor userspace

///
/// **This is a volume/frequency signal** for burst-write detection (ransomware, mass
/// tampering, log destruction), not a per-write path trail. To correlate a write with
/// a file path, detection rules must join to a recent [`FileOpenEvent`] on
/// `(meta.pid, fd)`.
///
/// ## Detection Correlation Pattern
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // Pseudo-code example: correlate FileOpen → FileWrite
/// match event {
///     Event::FileOpen(open) => {
///         // Store (pid, fd) → path mapping
///         state.track_fd(open.meta.pid, open.fd, open.path.clone());
///     }
///     Event::FileWrite(write) => {
///         // Look up path from prior FileOpen
///         if let Some(path) = state.get_path(write.meta.pid, write.fd) {
///             // Now you can detect: "wrote 1MB to /etc/passwd"
///             check_suspicious_write(path, write.bytes_requested);

///
/// ## Performance Notes
///
/// `write(2)` is one of the hottest syscalls in the system. Current implementation:
/// - Captures **every** write syscall (no size filtering)
/// - Expected rate: 10-1000+ events/sec under normal load, 10K+/sec under heavy I/O
/// - No built-in sampling or backpressure (Phase 1 implementation)
///
/// Future work (issue #262 Phase 2):
/// - Add min-size filter (e.g., skip writes < 4KB)
/// - Consider sampling under sustained high-volume
/// - Add `writev(2)`, `pwrite64(2)`, `pwritev(2)` coverage (currently only `write(2)`)
///
/// ## Syscall Coverage
///
/// Phase 1 (current): `write(2)` only
/// Phase 2 (deferred): `writev`, `pwrite64`, `pwritev`, `pwritev2`
///
/// Rationale for deferral: `write(2)` covers the common case; vectored/positioned
/// writes are used by databases and async I/O but add complexity (multiple fd/offset
/// pairs per syscall). Added once the Phase 1 signal proves useful and performance
/// characteristics are understood.
