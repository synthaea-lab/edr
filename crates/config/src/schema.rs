//! Types describing what the on-disk `agent.toml` file carries.
//!
//! Every field mirrors an [`ADR-0013`] decision or an obvious operational
//! setting. The struct layout **is** the file format — a new field is a
//! schema-visible change; a rename is a breaking change that requires a
//! [`SCHEMA_VERSION`] bump.
//!
//! [`ADR-0013`]: ../../../docs/adr/0013-agent-local-configuration.md
//!
//! ## Absent-field policy
//!
//! Every sub-section is serde-required (no `#[serde(default)]` on the
//! top-level struct), so a missing section fails the parse with a precise
//! error the operator can act on — silent defaults would defeat the
//! fail-fast rule from ADR-0013 §5. Inside a section, primitive fields that
//! do have a documented default value use `#[serde(default = "...")]` so
//! the template stays short without making the type ambiguous.
