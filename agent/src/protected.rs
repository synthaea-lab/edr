//! Protected-resource monitoring (issue #71, capability 3): the agent watches its own
//! on-disk footprint through the live event stream, and treats a write-intent open of
//! one of those paths by any process other than itself as a high-severity detection.
//!
//! Scope is deliberately limited to paths this agent process can know for certain at
//! its own runtime: its own executable (`std::env::current_exe`), its config file
//! (the path `config::discover` resolved at startup — the same file ADR-0013 makes
//! the agent fail fast over if it's missing, so it is worth protecting even though
//! operator-edited, not updater-managed), plus the alerts/events/heartbeat files it
//! was launched with. It does **not** cover the watchdog binary or the systemd
//! unit/OpenRC install surface — those live in `watchdog`'s own path resolution
//! (`watchdog/src/service/linux.rs`), and naming them here would mean either guessing
//! the packaging layout or a cross-binary dependency, neither of which this pass takes
//! on; `watchdog::tamper` (#103) already covers that surface from the install/supervise
//! side. True deletion is also out of scope: `FileOpenEvent` only observes `open(2)`,
//! so this catches a foreign write, truncate, or overwrite, not a foreign `rm`/`rename`
//! — both gaps stay tracked by issue #71 rather than being silently implied as covered.
//!
//! ## No `updater` allowlist (and why one line of #71 is stale)
//!
//! #71 originally called for treating `updater` as the one legitimate non-self writer
//! of these paths, since no updater existed yet to name. #30 shipped it since, and
//! turns out not to need the exception: `agent::release::cmd_apply_release` (ADR-0015)
//! downloads and verifies a new release into its own `versions/<N>/` directory and only
//! then swaps the `current` symlink — it never writes into the version directory the
//! running process's `current_exe` already resolves to, and it does not touch the
//! config file, alerts, events, or heartbeat paths at all (those are runtime/operator
//! state, not release artifacts). So a real self-update never opens a path this module
//! watches for write, and there is nothing today for an allowlist to legitimately admit.
