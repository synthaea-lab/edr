//! The enrichment + event-log worker — keeping hashing and signature verification
//! off the sensor's drain thread (issue #126).
//!
//! `DetectionSink::on_event` runs synchronously on the thread that drains the
//! kernel ring buffer / ETW session. Enrichment on a cache miss does a streaming
//! SHA-256 plus a signature verification (file reads + crypto), and misses cluster
//! (a software rollout, first boot, an attacker unpacking many payloads). Paid on
//! the capture thread, that stall is unbounded in aggregate and the kernel drops
//! telemetry once its buffer fills — the one thing an EDR must not do.
//!
//! So enrichment and the (high-volume) raw-event logging move here, behind a bounded
//! channel: the drain thread runs the in-memory detection engines and hands the
//! event off with a non-blocking `try_send`. No on-device engine consumes the hash
//! or signature synchronously (rules/Sigma/correlator all work on cmdline, lineage,
//! paths, and ports), so nothing detection-relevant waits on this. Overflow sheds
//! and counts, like `yara::ScanQueue` — the loss is a logged/enriched record under
//! extreme load, never a dropped detection and never stalled capture.
//!
//! [`EnrichQueue::flush`] (issue #341) gives `kill_loudness`'s shutdown path a
//! bounded way to wait for this backlog before the process exits — the backlog is
//! normally sub-millisecond, but a signal can land in the same instant an event
//! was captured, and without this the event is already lost downstream of a
//! successful `enqueue`, before it ever reaches `events.jsonl`. Bounded, not
//! unconditional: #71's kill-loudness deliberately hard-exits rather than run a
//! full clean shutdown, so a compromised or wedged process can't use its own
//! teardown path to outlast a termination signal — `flush`'s caller-supplied
//! timeout preserves that: the worst case is the same immediate exit as before,
//! just after a short, fixed wait instead of none.
