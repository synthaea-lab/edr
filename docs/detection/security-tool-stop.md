# Security-tool stop (SECURITY-TOOL-STOP, #379)

One stateless rule over the exec stream: `check_security_tool_stop`
(`crates/rules/src/securitytool.rs`, run by `evaluate_exec`). It is the T1562.001 (Impair
Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools) line of the Defense Evasion pack (#379) that needs no new
telemetry, and it adds the one thing the neighbouring rules do not say: **which** service was
stopped.

## The shape

An exec that stops a service of a fixed list of security tooling, as the command line says it:
`systemctl stop|disable --now|mask --now`, `service X stop`, `sc stop`, `net stop`,
`Stop-Service`, `launchctl bootout|unload|remove|stop`. The parser is the one of
SERVICE-STOP-BURST (`servicestop::services_stopped`): this rule asks which service, that one
counts how many. One alert per exec, T1562.001, **Medium**, naming the first listed service the
command stops.

| Platform | Services | Matched as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `auditd`, `apparmor`, `falco` (and `-bpf`, `-modern-bpf`), `osqueryd`, `wazuh-agent`, `ossec`, `clamav-daemon`, `clamd`, `suricata`, `snort`, `sysmon`, `mdatp`, `falcon-sensor`, `sentinelone` | exact name, `.service` suffix ignored |
| Windows | `WinDefend`, `WdNisSvc`, `Sense`, `Sysmon64`, `SecurityHealthService`, `CSFalconService`, `SentinelAgent`, `CbDefense` | exact name, any case |
| macOS | launchd labels under `com.crowdstrike.`, `com.sentinelone.`, `com.microsoft.wdav`, `com.carbonblack.`, `com.apple.xprotect` | vendor prefix |

The product names are as the vendors' documentation gives them and were **not checked on a host**:
a wrong name costs a missed stop, never a false alert.

## What it does not duplicate

- **SERVICE-STOP-BURST** (T1489, #970) counts at least five distinct services from one lineage in a
  minute. A single `systemctl stop falco` is below it by design; a burst that includes a security
  tool raises both, which is the intent.
- **`audit_service_masked_now` and `audit_collection_disabled`** (Sigma, Linux) name `mask --now
  auditd` and `auditctl -e 0`. `auditd` is on this list as well, so `mask --now auditd` raises
  both findings, and `systemctl stop auditd` raises this one only.
- **T1562.002** (#800) owns the Windows `EventLog` service and the audit policy: `eventlog` is
  deliberately **not** on the list. The firewall services (T1562.004) are not either.
- **`check_security_process_signal`** (#362) is the kill half, and only for the agent's own pid:
  the eBPF and Endpoint Security gates filter at the source. Another vendor's tool killed with
  `kill` is not seen by it.
- This agent's own service is **not** on the list: its package scripts stop it on every upgrade,
  and a stopped agent cannot alert on its own stop.

## Provisional and stated gaps

- It reads the **command**, not the outcome: a stop that is refused (`sc stop WinDefend` is denied on
  a current Windows), or any stop that does not go through these commands (`kill`, `pkill`,
  `taskkill`, D-Bus, an API call, `setenforce 0`, `aa-teardown`), is not seen. No event exists for
  unit lifecycle: the journal sensor emits SSH, PAM and `sudo` records, not unit start and stop,
  and the macOS unified-log tail emits TCC, `sudo` and Gatekeeper records.
- A service-name list is a list: a tool not on it is not covered. Windows display names (`net stop
  "Windows Defender Antivirus Service"`) are not matched, only service names.
- **Expected false positives, hence Medium**: an administrator stopping `auditd` or `clamav-daemon`
  to debug or upgrade, a package script, configuration management, an uninstall of an agent.
  Nothing is excluded by process name.
