//! `watchdog` — kill resistance for the agent. Migrated from `old/watchdog`.
//!
//! Four CLI subcommands:
//!   install   — installs the watchdog as a system service with auto-restart
//!   uninstall — uninstalls the service
//!   status    — shows the service state as the platform's service manager sees it
//!   run       — pure-Rust supervision loop (service entry point, or fallback without
//!               service rights)
//!
//! Kill resistance is the same two layers on every OS: the service manager runs the
//! watchdog (never the agent directly), and the watchdog's supervision loop spawns and
//! respawns the agent. Kill the agent → the watchdog restarts it; kill the watchdog →
//! the service manager restarts it. To stop it for good, go through the service manager:
//!   Windows: the watchdog is the Windows service; `sc failure` restart policy. (sc stop)
//!   Linux  : systemd unit with `Restart=always RestartSec=5s`.  (systemctl stop)
//!   macOS  : launchd daemon with `KeepAlive`.                   (launchctl bootout)
//!
//! On Unix a stop request arrives as SIGTERM (systemd stop, launchctl bootout); the
//! watchdog traps it, kills the agent, and exits — the same clean-stop semantics the
//! Windows SCM control handler provides.
//!
//! Module map: `paths` (agent/binary/log resolution), `supervise` (the respawn
//! loop), `service` (per-platform install/uninstall: SCM, systemd, launchd),
//! `tamper` (install-surface hardening and integrity checks, issue #103),
//! `probation` (post-promotion health gate and rollback, issue #30).
