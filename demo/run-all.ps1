.SYNOPSIS
    Orchestrates the four Windows deterministic-detection scenarios in demo order.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs, in this order:
        1. lab\scenarios\encoded-powershell.ps1         (T1059.001)
        2. lab\scenarios\scheduled-task-persistence.ps1 (T1053.005)
        3. lab\scenarios\service-install-persistence.ps1 (T1543.003)
        4. lab\scenarios\create-account-persistence.ps1 (T1136.001)

    Between scenarios: a short pause + a banner headline in the console, so
    the reviewer watching the agent's terminal (Terminal A) can associate
    each incoming alert group with the scenario that produced it.

    Each scenario is self-cleaning (`try/finally` in each script); this
    orchestrator does no cleanup of its own -- a partial run leaves the
    host in the correct state regardless of where it stopped.

.NOTES
    Usage:
        Terminal A (as Administrator):
            target\release\agent.exe run
        Terminal B (as Administrator):
            powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File demo\run-all.ps1

    See demo\README.md for the surrounding context and demo\expected-alerts.md
    for the exact alert lines the agent should print.

    Prerequisites: run this script AND the agent as Administrator. Each
    underlying scenario needs it (schtasks /Create, sc.exe create, net user
    /add all require elevation) and the agent needs it to read the Security
    log and enable audit subcategories.

    Timing: 3 iterations per scenario x 1s per iteration + 5s inter-scenario
    pause x 3 gaps = roughly 30 seconds total runtime, plus the eventlog
    sensor's 2-second poll lag on the persistence alerts.
